# Practice work I did at ITMO University
## Programming
### Summary
These are the lab works that I did at ITMO University for discipline called "Programming".  
The discipline was 2 semesters long and offered 8 lab-works to complete.  
However, labs through 1-4 and lab 8 was lost when my old notebook got burned.  
  
### What was in labs 1-4 and 8
Labs through 1-4 was by design to get to know Java programming language. This discipline is first step in our Software Engineering pathway in our University.  
Lab 1 - getting to know syntax of Java, learning a lot of theories and built a calculator.  
Lab 2 - getting to know OOP, classes, objects, extending, implementing.  
Lab 3 - getting to know SOLID, abstract, interface, static, enum.  
Lab 4 - getting to know Exception, Exception Handling, inner class, anonymous class, local class, reflection mechanism in Java.  
Lab 8 - getting to know JavaFX, Swing. Building an application with GUI.  

### What was in labs 5-7
[Lab5](Lab5):  
In the fifth lab we learnt to build a console application that does something by commands. 
What we learned:
- Java Collections
- Comparable and Comparator
- Generics & Wildcard
- IO and NIO
- javadoc

[Lab6](Lab6):
In the sixth lab we divided the previos lab to two sections: client and server  
Client and server communicates through TCP or UDP (depending on variant).  
What we learned:
- TCP: Socket, ServerSocket
- UDP: DatagramSocket, DatagramPacket
- SocketChannel & DatagramChannel
- Java custom Serialization & Deserialization
- Java Stream API
- GOF - Design Patterns

[Lab7](Lab7):
In the seventh lab we added more complexity to server, such as saving to database and concurency  
What we learned:
- Thread, Runnable
- JDBC, DriverManager
- ResultSet, Statement
- Lock, Condition
- java.util.concurrent
- volatile
- Executor Service, Executor, Callable, Future,
- Thread pools
